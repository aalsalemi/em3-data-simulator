# EM3 Appliance Level Energy Data Simulator

Developed by Mona Ramadan with help from Abdullah Alsalemi, Christos Sardianos, and Dr. Iraklis Varlamis under the project titled Consumer Engagement Towards Energy Saving Behavior by means of Exploiting Micro Moments and Mobile Recommendation Systems (EM3) led by Dr. Faycal Bensaali, Prof. Abbes Amira, and Dr. George Dimitrakopoulos.

A data simulation system that desegregates real smart meter data and periodic energy consumption habits, which are represented by micro-moments, we were able to simulate realistic domestic energy consumption scenarios. Pre-processing the aggregated readings and the application of a k-means clustering algorithm, user actions were detected (switch on/off) per appliance. Based on these records and using a a-priori itemset extraction algorithm we obtained appliance usage patterns. A minute-averaged dataset was simulated for three rooms and nine appliances, monitored for a 47-month period. We managed to extract frequent usage patterns at appliance-level, taking into account contextual parameters such as room occupancy. Moreover, the simulated datasets can be expanded to any size to a variety of energy saving applications such as micro-moment classification and goal-based recommender systems for energy saving.
